# CLOUD-CONNECTED-SMART-WEARABLE-SYSTEM-Mobile-computing-and-IOT-

To develop a Cloud based Smart Wearable system to make the user more situationally
aware while on outdoor trips. All the data (atmospheric temperature, humidity and
pressure, heart rate and the body temperature ) is stored on the cloud so as to help him
make better decisions about the location of such trips. Energy is conserved by giving
the user the ability to turn the device on and off whenever needed.
